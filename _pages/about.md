I am a third year PhD candidate in the School of Materials Science & Engineering, UNSW Sydney. My research aims at discoverying new two-dimensional perovskites for optoelectronics using computational tools.

I'm originally from Longkou, a beautiful harbour city in northeastern Shandong province, China. I moved to Hong Kong in 2013, where I completed my undergraduate and MPhil's degree at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. During my MPhil I study two-dimensional materials using experimental and computational approaches in the group of [Professor Jianhua Hao](https://ap.polyu.edu.hk/apjhhao/).

At UNSW, I work in [Professor Tom Wu](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/tom-wu)'s Group focusing on atomic scale simulation of two-dimensional perovskites for optoelectronics application.
