Hi there! I am currently a third year PhD candidate in School of Materials Science & Engineering, UNSW Sydney. Here I work in Prof. Tom Wu's Group, focusing on atomic scale simulation of two-dimensional (2D) perovskites for optoelectronics application.

I was born and raised in Longkou city, a beautiful harbour city in Shandong province, mainland China. I did my Bachelor and MPhil in applied physics at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. My MPhil's thesis mainly focused on synthesis and modeling of 2D materials.

In my spare time, I like listening to music. I enjoy learning different kinds of instruments, including piano, guitar, jazz drum. Recently I'm practicing fingerstyle guitar.
