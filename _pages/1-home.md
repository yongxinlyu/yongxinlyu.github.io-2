#### Yongxin Lyu
Hi! I am a PhD candidate in the School of Materials Science & Engineering, UNSW Sydney. My research aims at discoverying functional materials using high-throughput computational methods and interpretable machine learning.

I did my BSc and MPhil in Department of Applied Physics from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. During my MPhil I study two-dimensional materials using experimental and computational approaches in the group of [Professor Jianhua Hao](https://ap.polyu.edu.hk/apjhhao/).

At UNSW, I work in [Professor Tom Wu](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/tom-wu)'s group focusing on atomic scale simulation of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites for optoelectronics application.
