<h4 id="about-me">About me</h4>
<p>I am a third year PhD candidate in the School of Materials Science &amp; Engineering, UNSW Sydney. My research aims at discoverying new two-dimensional perovskites for optoelectronics using computational methods.</p>
<p>I&#39;m originally from northern China. I moved to Hong Kong in 2013, where I completed my undergraduate and MPhil&#39;s degree at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. During my MPhil I study two-dimensional materials using experimental and computational approaches in the group of <a href="https://ap.polyu.edu.hk/apjhhao/">Professor Jianhua Hao</a>.</p>
<p>At UNSW, I work in <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/tom-wu">Professor Tom Wu</a>&#39;s Group focusing on atomic scale simulation of two-dimensional perovskites for optoelectronics application.</p>
