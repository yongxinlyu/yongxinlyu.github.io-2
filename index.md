## Hi there!

I am currently a second year PhD student in School of Materials Science and Engineering at University of New South Wales (UNSW). Here I work under Prof.Tom Wu, focusing on atomic scale simulation of two-dimensional(2D) perovskite for optoelectronics application.

I was born and raised in Longkou city, a beautiful harbour city in Shandong province, mainland China. I did my Bachelor and MPhil in applied physics at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. My MPhil's thesis mainly focused on synthesis and modeling of 2D materials.

In my spear time, I like listening to music. I enjoy learning different kinds of instruments, including piano, guitar, jazz drum. Recently I'm practicing fingerstyle guitar.
